# React-Tailwind-Assignment

> Project Overview
The "Greeting Cards" is a React-based project designed to create and display greeting cards dynamically using props. The main objective of this project was to practice creating reusable components, styling them with TailwindCSS, and understanding the integration of modern web technologies like Vite for efficient project scaffolding. During the process, I improved my understanding of React's component architecture, learned how to configure TailwindCSS, and explored how to create visually appealing layouts with responsive design principles.

> Discussion
Working on this project was both challenging and rewarding. I worked independently and faced issues getting TailwindCSS to work initially due to a misconfiguration in the tailwind.config.js file. After troubleshooting and carefully reviewing the installation steps, I was able to resolve the problem and successfully style the application. This project allowed me to practice React fundamentals, including component creation, props passing, and state management. Additionally, configuring TailwindCSS and experimenting with its utility classes enhanced my skills in modern web design. Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience and helped me better understand the importance of debugging and attention to detail when integrating new technologies.
